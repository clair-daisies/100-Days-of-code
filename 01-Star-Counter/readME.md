Day 1

We all remember the days when it doesn't stop raining stars.
You much have wondered, Oh I wish there was an app to keep a track these things.
Luckily for you, there is one now!
I thought to put my recent skill of Javascript to good use and build an app that helps us all by counting the number of stars rained on that particular day.
Hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š
